## Installation
Git clone the repo onto your hard drive. Open the folder in CLion and build/run.

## To Contribute
First, fork the repo on GitHub. Make a branch from main with `git branch [branch-name]`, title it appropriately for the intended changes. Commit to the branch like normal with changes. After finishing the code, push your commits to your fork. You will have to have two git remotes named something like 'origin' and 'fork' created with `git remote add [remote-name]` and you can push to the fork with `git push [fork-remote] [branch-name] `Lastly, create a pull request from your fork to the main GitHub repo, so that the other contributors can review your code and then approve the pull request.

## TODO (tentative)
- Separate ImGui functionality into a class
- Create 3 different sorting algorithm visualization tools
- Generate imaginary state data
- Configure GUI app using ImGui
- Integrate visualizations into GUI app
